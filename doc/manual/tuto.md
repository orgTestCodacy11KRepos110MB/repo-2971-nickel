# Managing users

In this tutorial, you will learn how use Nickel to manage a list of users,
and then export it as a YAML file for a program consuming it.

## Step 1: Install nickel

## Step 2: Think about the schema

Our current YAML has different fields, such as `name`, `ssh-keys`,
`is-admin` or `extra-groups`. To create a Nickel contract that correctly
specifies the shape of this data, we first need to think about the
types of each field

Nickel provides a lot of types, but also structures. In our case,
we want `ssh-keys` to allow multiple keys, so this will be an array,
`name` is a sequence of characters, so a type `Str` (for String),
the field `is-admin` can be either true or false, so this is a
`Bool`, finally, `extra-groups` is a list of group names,
which translates as an array of string.

We can also mark fields as optional, so you don't have
to fill them if they don't have any value, `extra-groups` and `ssh-keys`
can be empty in our case, we will make them optional by applying `|
optional`.

The field `is-admin` must be present in the YAML we output, but
for most users it will be set to `false`. We can give the field
a default value of `false`, which means it only needs to be
present in Nickel code when the user is actually an admin.

## Step 3: Write a contract

```nickel
{
  UserSchema =
  {
    name | Str,
    ssh-keys | Array Str | optional,
    is-admin | Bool | default = false,
    extra-groups | Array Str | optional,
  },
}
```

## Step 4: Write users

```nickel
let {UserSchema, ..} = import "users-schema.ncl" in
{
  users | Array UserSchema =
  [
    {
      name = "Alice",
      is-admin = true,
      extra-groups = [ "support"],
      ssh-keys = [
        "AAAAAe4QAAAAAB5OLAo1...... alice@nixos",
        "AAAAA26vx+AqGIPZd/NT...... alice@android",
      ],
    },

    {
      name = "Bob",
      extra-groups = [ "pentester"],
    },

    {
      name = "Mallory"
    },

    {
      name = "Grace",
      is-admin = true,
      extra-groups = [ "administrative" ],
    },
 ]
}
```

## Step 5: Export as YAML

By default, nickel exports as JSON type, so we need to use the extra
parameter `--format yaml` to export as YAML.

```shell
nickel -f users.ncl export --export yaml
```

gives this result:

```yaml
---
users:
  - extra-groups:
      - support
    is-admin: true
    name: Alice
    ssh-keys:
      - AAAAAe4QAAAAAB5OLAo1...... alice@nixos
      - AAAAA26vx+AqGIPZd/NT...... alice@android
  - extra-groups:
      - pentester
    name: Bob
  - name: Mallory
  - extra-groups:
      - administrative
    is-admin: true
    name: Grace
```
